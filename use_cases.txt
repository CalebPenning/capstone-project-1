Users should have to, upon page load (or before), confirm that they are of legal age.
Upon confirming age, homepage is loaded for non logged in users.
Non logged in visitors will be able to see the homepage, which will have the latest
offerings, limited to about 12 in a three column row, information about the shop,
a navbar with anchors for logging in, signing up, as well as viewing the current selection.
They will not have a cart or the option to add items to a cart.

Users interested in ordering will click 'sign up', and be taken to a sign-up form.
Upon successful registration, users are automatically logged in for the rest of their session 
(session ends on browser close) and redirected to a new, user-oriented homepage.

offerings similar to ones they've ordered before, offerings they have book marked.
